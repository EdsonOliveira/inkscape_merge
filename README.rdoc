= inkscape_merge

Script to merge SVG files with CSV data-files using Inkscape, to produce
one outputfile (e.g. PDF) per data-row.

Script inspired by and based on Aur√©lio A. Heckert excellent
InkscapeGenerator (http://wiki.colivre.net/Aurium/InkscapeGenerator)

Heckert's original script unfortunately broke for me several times and 
I took the opportunity to rewrite it and make it more extendable for future.
