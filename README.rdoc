= inkscape_merge

Script to merge SVG files with CSV data-files using Inkscape, to produce
one outputfile (e.g. PDF) per data-row.

Script inspired by and based on Aur√©lio A. Heckert excellent
InkscapeGenerator (http://wiki.colivre.net/Aurium/InkscapeGenerator)

Heckert's original script unfortunately broke for me several times and 
I took the opportunity to rewrite it and make it more extendable for future.

= Requirements

* Inkscape (preferably in PATH)

= USAGE

== Install the gem

  gem install inkscape_merge

== Create files

Create CSV data file with first row as a header. The values from this row are
used as keys in the SVG file substitution.

Create SVG file that contains some variables in the form:

  %VAR_name%

Where `name` is the name of a column in the CSV file created previously.
These variables can be anywhere inside the SVG, from plain text nodes to color values.
This script just brute-forcedly `gsubs` these values as text w/o any thought.

== Run the script

The script requires at least three arguments:
* the input SVG file
* the input CSV file
* and the output file `pattern`

Note: output pattern undergoes the same substitutions as the SVG file, so to create easily unique file names.
Additionally the output pattern can contain `%d` which is replaced with current row number.

Example:
  inkscape_merge -f postcard.svg -d names.csv -o postcards/card_%d.pdf
  
This produces files like:
* postcards/
  * card_1.pdf
  * card_2.pdf
